# quantum_spectral_clustering
the code of quantum spectral clustering
The python code for quantum spectral clustering. For details of quantum spectral clustering, please refer to reference https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03132.
The main file is sparse spectral clustering.ipynb.

## TODOlist
* Add more detailed code comments  

* Refactored code to make it clearer

We encourage interested people to implement their own code according to the references https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03132, which is easy.
